## 🧠 How It Works

PostForge uses **Few-shot prompting** — a technique where the model learns from a few examples of high-performing LinkedIn posts.  
Instead of training a new model, it’s guided by sample posts (FewShotPosts) to mimic style, tone, and structure.

This lets the AI create human-like, topic-relevant posts that sound natural and professional.
