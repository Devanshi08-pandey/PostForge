Then I met Bob Chapman.\n\nFor 50 years, Bob has led Barry-Wehmiller, a Midwestern manufacturing company that\u2019s grown into a $3.6 billion global success story. So, we went to the factory in Phillips, Wisconsin where Bob first showed me that the world I imagined could actually exist. And I got to speak with the people whose lives have been changed by his leadership.\n\nThis episode of A Bit of Optimism is sponsored by the Porsche Cars North America Macan.\n\nFind the full episode of A Bit of Optimism wherever you get your podcasts: 'The Man Who Proved Me Right with CEO Bob Chapman and the Barry-Wehmiller Team'",

He\u2019s the man who proved what I\u2019ve been talking about for years isn\u2019t just theory.\n\nBob built a global manufacturing company that never lays off employees and has so deeply woven the belief that people come first into his culture that its impact ripples out to families, communities, and the world.

Don\u2019t you know who I am!' Without missing a beat, the check-in agent smiled and said over the PA system: \u2018Attention everybody, we seem to have a passenger here who doesn\u2019t know who he is. If anyone can help find his identity, please come to Gate 14\u2019 The man then replied: \u2018F*** you\u2019, to which the check-in agent said: \u2018Sorry sir, you\u2019ll have to get in line for that too.\u2019 Now that\u2019s one way to deal with a difficult customer!",

For example, there\u2019s a fascinating study about resilience from the 1980s that followed workers at Illinois Bell Telephone as the phone industry was being deregulated. The company was downsized 50 percent in one year in what was considered the largest upheaval in corporate history.\n\nWhat the researchers found is that those who were able to make the transition a success used, as they put it, the \u2018three C attitudes.\u2019 First, there was commitment: deciding to join in and try to be a part of the solution. Next was control: fighting to maintain a sense of resolve as opposed to resignation. And last was a challenge: finding ways to use the crisis to strengthen themselves, to build resilience and grow.\n\nThe most important thing to remember about resilience is that it\u2019s not a finite resource or a fixed quality that we\u2019re either born with or not. Just as we can learn other skills through practice, we can teach ourselves to be more resilient.",
