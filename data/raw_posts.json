Then I met Bob Chapman.\n\nFor 50 years, Bob has led Barry-Wehmiller, a Midwestern manufacturing company that’s grown into a $3.6 billion global success story. So, we went to the factory in Phillips, Wisconsin where Bob first showed me that the world I imagined could actually exist. And I got to speak with the people whose lives have been changed by his leadership.\n\nThis episode of A Bit of Optimism is sponsored by the Porsche Cars North America Macan.\n\nFind the full episode of A Bit of Optimism wherever you get your podcasts: 'The Man Who Proved Me Right with CEO Bob Chapman and the Barry-Wehmiller Team'",

Not in the slides.\nIt’s built in the tiny moments—the hallway chats, the ‘how’s your dad doing?’ check-ins, the post-call laughs.\n\nThat’s where culture quietly compounds.\n\nRemote teams don’t get those moments by accident; you have to engineer them.\n\nCreate space for non-work huddles\nCheck in just to say hi\nCelebrate people when no one’s asking you to\n\nBecause trust isn’t a value on the wall. It’s the feeling people have when the meeting’s over.",

They’re a symptom of a system that’s lost its heart.\n\nNext week, A Bit of Optimism returns on Tuesday with a brand new episode featuring Bob Chapman, who has been the CEO of Barry-Wehmiller for more than 50 years. He’s the man who proved what I’ve been talking about for years isn’t just theory.\n\nBob built a global manufacturing company that never lays off employees and has so deeply woven the belief that people come first into his culture that its impact ripples out to families, communities, and the world. His philosophy of Truly Human Leadership shows that capitalism can be kind and still be financially successful.\n\nThis conversation is proof that empathy and business are not opposites—they’re the future.",

That’s when the cracks show.\n\nPut them first.\nSolve the business problem second. That’s how brands outlast campaigns.",

  "text": "Just fantastic to see Virgin Australia named the most trusted travel & tourism brand for the third year running. Beyond safety and on-time performance, trust is built in the small moments. The smile at check-in, the bubbly announcement on the PA system, the quick solution when something doesn’t quite go to plan.\n\nI always love the story of when a very angry passenger barged through the queue and shouted at a Virgin Australia check-in agent: ‘I have to get on this flight, and it has to be first class! Don’t you know who I am!' Without missing a beat, the check-in agent smiled and said over the PA system: ‘Attention everybody, we seem to have a passenger here who doesn’t know who he is. If anyone can help find his identity, please come to Gate 14’ The man then replied: ‘F*** you’, to which the check-in agent said: ‘Sorry sir, you’ll have to get in line for that too.’ Now that’s one way to deal with a difficult customer!",

  "text": "Such a powerful interview with the Prime Minister of Poland, Donald Tusk on the risk of a permanent forever war in Ukraine, unless the world steps up.\n\nUkraine is prepared to keep fighting for another two or three years, but no country should have to face a decade of war. As Tusk said, the real question is not whether Ukraine will survive, but how many lives will be lost along the way. Where do you draw the line on human lives.\n\nHe also warned that complacency in the West is dangerous. Russian cyberattacks, sabotage, and disinformation are already happening across Europe. The idea that this is ‘someone else’s war’ must end.\n\nAs I have said countless times: freedom anywhere depends on defending it everywhere. It’s a stark truth: peace, democracy, and security can’t be taken for granted. They demand courage, unity, and sacrifice. These are values that Ukraine shows every day on the frontlines.",

A single extreme weather event—heat, cold, flooding—can create food shortages, loss of income, and push families deeper into poverty.\n\nI’ve witnessed the power of farmer-led solutions. From AI weather forecasting to mobile apps that offer planting advice—these innovations are helping farmers adapt to climate shocks, strengthen livelihoods, and secure a more resilient future for entire communities. That’s why the Gates Foundation is committing $1.4 billion over four years to support agricultural innovations that help smallholder farmers navigate a changing climate.\n\nThe potential is even greater if governments, philanthropies, and the private sector join us in advancing these resilience-focused solutions. Let’s invest in the people who feed us all.",

  "text": "Our homes are getting dumber.\n\nIn Axios, Sami Sparber writes that ‘“Dumb homes” are the latest flex,’ with more people ditching high-tech smart homes and appliances for things with buttons and knobs.\n\nSome are creating digital detox spaces, as part of the ‘analog wellness’ movement. For example, reading nooks are now being mentioned 48% more in Zillow listings than a year ago. And landlines are gaining new fans among parents who want their kids to have more connection and less screen time.\n\nAs architect Yan M. Wang put it, a home where ‘technology is always in the background, working and listening, feels anxiety-producing’ instead of restorative.\n\nSo maybe it’s not just that homes are getting dumber, but that the humans inside them are getting smarter about their relationship to technology.",

  "text": "Though the impact of this technology is very new, the human qualities we need to navigate how AI is changing our lives are as old as we are.\n\nAnd there are lessons to be found in other times of turbulence. For example, there’s a fascinating study about resilience from the 1980s that followed workers at Illinois Bell Telephone as the phone industry was being deregulated. The company was downsized 50 percent in one year in what was considered the largest upheaval in corporate history.\n\nWhat the researchers found is that those who were able to make the transition a success used, as they put it, the ‘three C attitudes.’ First, there was commitment: deciding to join in and try to be a part of the solution. Next was control: fighting to maintain a sense of resolve as opposed to resignation. And last was a challenge: finding ways to use the crisis to strengthen themselves, to build resilience and grow.\n\nThe most important thing to remember about resilience is that it’s not a finite resource or a fixed quality that we’re either born with or not. Just as we can learn other skills through practice, we can teach ourselves to be more resilient.",

  "text": "Good people of LinkedIn! >> Why do people now think Ye Olde Em Dash is a sign of AI writing?\n\nIt's been around for roughly 400 years—long before Clippy, autocorrect, neural networks, or anyone imagined punctuation could enrage a mob. It's vintage!\n\nSo why are people now patrolling the streets of LinkedIn with torches and pitchforks, rounding up em dashes like it’s CSI: Grammar Unit?\n\n>> Because of a perfect storm of style, superstition, and machine mimicry.\n\nAI models love the em dash... because *humans* do.\n\nLarge language models are trained on millions of human-written sentences. (Mostly stolen, it must be said.)\n\nAnd we modern writers use em dashes a lot. They mimic our conversational, emotional, sometimes delightfully digressive voice—the kind that wanders, like it's doing right here—before it plops its peach 🍑 into a seat and parks itself on the page.\n\nSo when AI learned to ‘sound human,’ it slipped on our favorite cardigan: the em dash.\n\nWhen people started noticing dashes popping up everywhere in ChatGPT writing... I mean, 'outputs'... they mistook the symptom for the cause.\n\nMaybe before you accuse anyone of ‘writing like AI,’ ask yourself:\n\nWho’s actually robotic ... the writer using rhythm and nuance?\nOr the reader... following a rulebook?\n\n* * *\n\nHere's why this matters at all: Punctuation isn’t about grammar.\n\nIt’s a kind of wingman for your words—it helps them come alive in another’s mind.\n\nWriting, like punctuation, is less about rules and more about listening for the rhythm and the beats beneath the words. It’s taste, timing, feeling... and the beautiful mess of being unmistakably human.\n\nWhich is all to say... ***Justice! For! Em Dashes!***\n\nNotice how em dashes work—whether you're reading them here, on LinkedIn, on a tote bag, in a poem. rhythm of writing—the beats beneath the words.\n\nSaid another way:\n\nYou can tell a lot about a writer by how they use an em dash.\nYou can tell even more by whether they're afraid to.\n\nIt's time for us writers to reclaim what's ours! It's time to BE FEARLESS.\n\nWho's with me?\n\nP.S. Should we actually produce this rallying cry of a t-shirt? Y or N.\n\nP.P.S. Print On Demand companies: Anyone wanna help? 👕",
